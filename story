Once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey on a tree which was on tha banks of the river. In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile visited the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits, the crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as the days passed by the monkey and the crocodile became good friends.
the monkey and the crocodile spent a lot of time together.
